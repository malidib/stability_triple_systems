# Stability of circumbinary planets
A model that Predicts the orbital stability of circumbinary planets using Machine Learning fits to N-body simulations.
Included as pickle files are 4 trained models, corresponding to the inner and outer stability radius for low and high eccentricity planets. 
inference.py is a simple inference script. It loads the saved models, take input, and make prediction.
